<n1>Believe In Yourself</n1>
<p>
<b>Believe in yourself and in your dream <br><br>
Though impossible things may seem </b><br><br>
<i>Someday,somehow you'll get through <br>
To the goal you have in view </i><br><br>
<u>Mountains fall and seas divide <br><br>
Before the one who in his stride </u><br><br>
<strong>Takes a hard road day by day <br><br>
Sweeping obstacles away </strong><br><br>
<em>Believe in yourself and in your plan<br><br>
Say not-i cannot-but,i can </em><br><br>
<small>The prizes of life we fail to win</small><br><br>
<mark>Because we doubt the power within </mark><br><br>
